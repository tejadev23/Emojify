😊 Emojify – Facial Expression to Emoji Converter  

🤖 **AI-powered Facial Expression Recognition** | **Convert Faces to Emojis!**  

This project uses **Computer Vision and Machine Learning** to detect facial expressions and generate corresponding emojis in real time. The model is trained to classify emotions such as **happy, sad, angry, surprised, and neutral**, mapping them to relevant emojis.  

## 🚀 Features  
✔️ Detects **facial expressions** in real-time using OpenCV  
✔️ Maps expressions to **appropriate emojis**  
✔️ Trained using **CNN on a facial emotion dataset**  
✔️ Supports **live webcam input and image uploads**  

## 📂 Dataset  
The model is trained on a **Facial Emotion Dataset** from **Kaggle**, containing labeled expressions such as happy, sad, angry, neutral, etc.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python** (OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas)  
- **Machine Learning** (CNN, TensorFlow/Keras)  
- **Deep Learning** (Convolutional Neural Networks)  
- **Frontend** (Flask for Web Interface)
